#### Highlight

* High risk on completion of 2016 roadmap projects due to lack of resource. TW ops team takes over many regular maintenance, review and survey tasks from UK team. In the same time, project related tasks are always first priority.

#### Achieved

###### 2016 Roadmap:

* Vulnerability Review Action
    * DeepSecurity Adoption (Caleb Studying)        - Study agent, relay, manager relationship and how to deploy via proxy* Service/Infra Improvement and Stablization.    * New patch management tool – vFense. (Charles Studying) 
        - Follow document to test server and client.    * Monitis alert to Slack service. (Caleb Implementing)        
        - Leverage AWS Lambda/API Gateway/S3 services to support multiple projects in a central micro web service        - Beta test on Shinra project        - [Issue] Monitis notification cannot send to HTTPS webhook (Monitis back-end team found cause. The fix will be pushed live in the mid of May.)    * Container Management. (Kevin, Flyfox)        - All monitoring container are migrate to Kubernetes. Now we can use kubernetes command line to start all monitoring container.        -	Currently, we have many container monitor web. We need a method to integrate all web sites to a single entry. Now we are integrating all operational website to a single node and use an nginx as proxy server.        - Container monitor web: Prometheus, Pushgateway, Alertmanager, Grafana, Icinga, Smokeping…
        ###### Event and Tasks:

* Service/Infra Improvement and Stablization.
    * Study Vagrant Box image update (Jeffery)        -	UK office handover task        -	Vagrant box 64bit cannot run on VMware and AWS environments.
    * DNS for GitForwarder (Caleb)        -	DCS team update new GitForwarder instances        -	Create and test an internal DNS entry (git-int.trendops.co)    * Elastic Search puppet refactoring (Charles)        -	Clean up unused code and upgrade curator package        -	Fix data purge issue and Merged to master new
    * Monitor and Metric for common pool (Eric/Derek)        - Monitoring items for MQTT protocol        -	Dashboard (Gdash) for RDS-Postgresql on AWS        -	Dashboard (Gdash) for AWS Billing
    * Docker Registry container solution (Derek)        -	Survey docker registry container solution. It will be used in any project that needs to manage docker image.
