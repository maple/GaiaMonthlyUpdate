#### Highlight

* High risk on completion of 2016 roadmap projects due to lack of resource. 
* TW ops team takes over many regular maintenance, review and survey tasks from UK team. In the same time, project related tasks are always first priority.

#### Achieved

###### 2016 Roadmap:

* Vulnerability Review Action
    * DeepSecurity Adoption (Caleb Studying)        - Study agent, relay, manager relationship and how to deploy via proxy
        - Known integration limitations:            - Instance behind proxy cannot update components and rules            - Docker environment has not been supported            - Before updating kernel patch, please make sure DSA’s support list            - DSaaS uses DSA to DSM communication model. But for DSM to DSA, there is a long list of DSM IP address in ACL* Service/Infra Improvement and Stablization.    * New patch management tool – vFense. (Charles Studying) 
        - Setup and configure the connection and accounts for vFense and vFense-agent        - Review the activity and issues from community        - Evaluating this tool by all devops members    * Monitis alert to Slack service. (Caleb Done)        
        -	[Issue] Monitis notification cannot send to HTTPS webhook (fixed)        - Go production for Shinra/Tellus/TMPN/Atom/SafeSync/Yamato projects
    * Container Management. (Kevin, Flyfox, Derek Demo)        - Deploy the framework in ATOM project by Ansible        - Study smokeping replacement in docker.        -	Worldping is a plugin for grafana which can ping your service from the worldwide and get performance data.        - Study cloudwatch grafana plugin. Use grafana cloud watch plugin, we can direct display the cloudwatch metric directly.
    * Staging repository for 3rd party Ubuntu packages [Caleb Implementing]        - Automatically monitor and download 3rd party Ubuntu packages to self staging repository for further review and test        -	Puppet module implementing for TMPN required php5.6 packages        ###### Event and Tasks:

* Service/Infra Improvement and Stablization.
    * Split /data and /var/www volumes on packagebuild server to avoid data lost (Caleb)
    * Regular patches update on all trendops machines (Caleb)    * Apache puppet module update (Doma)
    * Upgrade the timezone module in puppet and setup the default timezone as “Etc/UTC” in each project. (Eric)
    * Move some system monitoring items from consumer and commercial module to trend module. It helps to integrate the duplicated items and apply all basic check for all machines. (Eric)
    * Fix the notification of “mute” icinga monitoring items. Some items are mute due to operation event but forget to turn on it after finish the job. Therefore we will send out a notification to remind ops to turn on it again. (Eric)    * Fix some bugs in opsaws packages. Release 2016.5.0 version. (Eric)    * Remove eyaml support in puppet. (Eric)    * Remove Rsyslog package in Ubuntu Trusty repo. We will use the official one in the future. (Eric)    * Change the git merge time (masterbeta, betaproduction ) to 10 AM TW time (Eric)
    * OpenSSL announced vulnerability CVE-2016-2107 and CVE-2016-2108 at 5/3. The priority is high. Help to collect related information and apply the patch in each project.  If the system is CentOS or Ubuntu, official patch is released. (All)
    * We used 3rd party service to send text message to mobile phone when critical event occur in our service.  Twilio is a service that major on this. It is cheaper and easier to be integrated into our monitor system than the previous solution (sms-world). It also can receive SMS online or make a voice call. Currently, we integrate it with Icinga and use the SMS sender function only. (Eric)
    * Kibana 4.1.6 support objects import / export feature. We can export our dashboard/ visualization data configuration to file and import to another site. (Kevin)
    * Add postgresql and redis template in order to monitor metrics quickly and benefit all projects that using these two components on AWS. (Derek)
