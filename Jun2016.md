#### Highlight

* High risk on completion of 2016 roadmap projects due to lack of resource. 
* TW ops team takes over many regular maintenance, review and survey tasks from UK team. In the same time, project related tasks are always first priority.

#### Achieved

###### 2016 Roadmap:

* Vulnerability Review Action
    * DeepSecurity Adoption (Caleb Studying)        - Study agent, relay, manager relationship and how to deploy via proxy
        - Deploy to Tellus INT for testing* Service/Infra Improvement and Stablization.        
    * Container Management. (Kevin, FlyFox, Derek Demo+PoC)        - Use Flanneld to connect ops machines with containers. Split out ops machines and database from kubernetes.        -	Use influxDB to collect metrics.    
    * Staging repository for 3rd party Ubuntu packages [Caleb Implementing]            - Automatically monitor and download 3rd party Ubuntu packages to self staging repository for further review and test        -	Puppet module implementing for TMPN required php5.6 packages        ###### Event and Tasks:

* Vulnerability Review Action
    * Nginx/Nodejs additional security HTTP headers (Eric) 
    * Nginx Vulnerability (All)
    * Update patches for Trendops machines (Caleb)* Service/Infra Improvement and Stablization.            * Stop patchmaster1 test machine (Caleb)    * Enhanced Network on AWS (Flyfox)
